# MyNixOS
A collection of my dotfiles for nixos.

## What do I do with these?

Simply clone the repo, move the contents into /etc/nixos (overwriting the existing files with the existing names) **to your existing NixOS installation**. Then install the home-manager channels for both your user and root, as described by the nixOS community. Finally change the username and hostname to suit.
